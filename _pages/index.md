I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Physics at the University of Texas at Austin. I work with Professor [Patrick Heimbach](https://heimbach.wordpress.com/) as a part of the Computational Research in Ice and Ocean group (CRIOS) at the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences.  My research  is focused on parameterizations of subgrid-scale processes in general circulation models of the ocean, in particular the MITgcm as a member of the NASA-funded Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) consortium.

I graduated *cum laude* with a BA in Physics and minor in Math from Carleton College in 2019. I was awarded the honor of distinction in the physics major for my [senior thesis](/assets/documents/trostel-thesis.pdf) work under the supervision of Professors [Joel M. Weisberg](https://people.carleton.edu/~jweisber/joelhome.html) and [Arjendu K. Pattanayak](https://people.carleton.edu/~arjendu/).

Outside of research I try to spend as much time as possible adventuring outdoors -- canoe-tripping, backpacking, and rock climbing -- some of which is documented here.
